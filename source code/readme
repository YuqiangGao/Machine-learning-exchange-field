QUIP is a machine learning molecular dynamics code based on GAP-SOAP. We implemented our machine learning model for noncollinear spin in the QUIP software. 
By copy the src folder into QUIP source code, it can read noncollinear spin configurations and train the machine learning model for the exchange field between spins.
